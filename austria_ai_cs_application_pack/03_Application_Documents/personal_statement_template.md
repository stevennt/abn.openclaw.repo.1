# Personal Statement Template (AI/CS)

I have always been curious about how systems think, learn, and make decisions. This curiosity became a clear goal during high school when I started building small software projects and exploring the foundations of artificial intelligence.

As an 11th-grade student at [SCHOOL_NAME], I have focused on mathematics and computer science, because I understand that strong fundamentals are essential for advanced work in AI. Through [specific project/course], I learned how programming can transform ideas into practical tools that solve everyday problems.

One experience that strongly influenced me was [describe one project/challenge]. It taught me not only technical skills, but also patience, experimentation, and responsibility when designing systems that affect people.

I am applying to study in Austria because I value its high-quality education system, strong technical universities, and international academic environment. I want to study in a place that combines theory, innovation, and practical impact.

My goal is to become a capable computer scientist with specialisation in AI, contributing to solutions in [healthcare/education/smart systems/climate technology]. I am committed to hard work, continuous learning, and ethical use of technology.

I believe this next step in Austria will help me grow into both a stronger engineer and a responsible global citizen.
